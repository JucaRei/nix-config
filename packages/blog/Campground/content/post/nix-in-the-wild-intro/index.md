# Nix in the Wild: Exploring the Power of Nix for Organizational Codebases

Welcome to the first post in an open-ended series Iâ€™m calling "Nix in the Wild," where we will explore how Nix can
revolutionize project management in your organization. This series is tailored for DevOps engineers, software
developers, and IT managers looking to enhance automation and consistency in their workflows. I will demonstrate
how to transition a typical codebase to use Nix and codify the structure of our projects to provide many assurances
about them. We will delve into various ideas and concepts related to using Nix in an organizational context.
Specifically, I aim to provide real-world examples of how to replace tools like [Cookiecutter](https://www.cookiecutter.io/), [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
and [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible) with Nix. I have created a
[demo repository](https://gitlab.com/initech-project/main-codebase) that I will use to illustrate these concepts.

## Why Nix?

Why do I need something new? I already use templates to generate new projects and have Docker to help deploy my
applications to Kubernetes. These are valid questions. However, as the number of projects scales, the problems
grow exponentially. It becomes increasingly challenging to keep projects created with older versions of templates in
sync with current best practices. For example, I created the [Initech main codebase repository](https://gitlab.com/initech-project/main-codebase)
using a [Cookiecutter template](https://gitlab.com/usmcamp0811/cronus) that I made three years ago to standardize new Python
projects with best practices like [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) and avoiding `latest` tags in `Dockerfile`.
However, when attempting to create projects for the demo repository using this template, the Docker images failed to build.
This experience highlights the need for Nix in our workflow. Once templates are instantiated, they become static,
necessitating manual updates for each instance.

_Note: This is why some things in the demo repo might not build or work as expected. I didn't spend much time fixing them right now._

Nix offers several advantages, such as automatically generating a [software bill of materials](https://www.cisa.gov/sbom)
for every package, project, or system you create. This is a feature you essentially get for free with Nix,
and using a simple tool like [sbomnix](https://github.com/tiiuae/sbomnix) can enhance your projects transparency and security.
Additionally, onboarding new team members becomes significantly faster. Instead of spending a week reading through READMEs
to configure their development environment, new hires can use [Nix dev shells](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Development_environment_with_nix-shell).
They simply clone the project and run `nix develop`, instantly accessing the exact same environment as the rest of
the team, streamlining setup.

Moreover, Nix can drastically simplify your CI/CD pipelines. It ensures that testing environments are identical to
deployment environments by hashing all inputs and preventing internet access during the build and installation phases.
This guarantees that the installed packages are consistent, reducing time spent troubleshooting discrepancies.

Furthermore, Nix's purely functional package management system allows for precise definition and versioning of project
dependencies and environment configurations, ensuring consistent and repeatable builds across different systems.
In simpler terms, Nix provides a way to describe and manage the infrastructure surrounding your project, allowing
for centralized updates and eliminating the drift between old and new projects. This makes it easier to maintain
best practices and ensures reliable deployments, significantly reducing time spent troubleshooting and aligning
project environments.

By using Nix, you not only streamline your setup processes but also ensure reliable deployments, significantly cutting
down on time spent resolving environment-related issues.

## Overview of the Series

In this series, I will guide you through the following steps:

1. **Converting the Demo Repository**: Transform the demo repository into a fully configured [Nix Flake](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes).
2. **Standardizing Project Creation**: Demonstrate how Nix library functions can standardize the creation of new projects, ensuring they adhere to consistent configurations.
3. **Using Nix for Development**: Explore how Nix can be utilized not just for packaging projects, but also to support and streamline the development process.
4. **Design Decisions and Lessons Learned**: Share insights from the design decisions made during the transition and the lessons learned along the way.
5. **Integrating Nix with Kubernetes**: Present ideas on how Nix can be integrated into your Kubernetes workflows to enhance deployment and management.

These ideas are just the beginning and are not complete or comprehensive.

## Setting Up Nix

Before we go any further, let's get Nix installed and set up. There are several ways to install Nix, but the most
reliable method is using the [Determinate Systems installer](https://github.com/DeterminateSystems/nix-installer). This
installer ensures a smooth and consistent installation process.

For most cases, the following command should result in Nix being installed:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf -L https://install.determinate.systems/nix | sh -s -- install
```

After running this command, follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation. This script will handle
all the necessary steps to set up Nix on your system.

### Verifying the Installation

Once the installation is complete, you can verify that Nix is installed correctly by running:

```bash
nix --version
```

You should see the version number of Nix displayed, confirming that the installation was successful.

## Conclusion

In this post, we introduced the foundational concepts of using Nix to standardize and streamline project management
within an organization. We explored why Nix is essential for overcoming the limitations of traditional templates and
discussed its benefits in terms of reproducibility, simplicity, and reliability. By following this series, you will
learn how to convert your projects into fully configured Nix Flakes, standardize project creation, and integrate Nix
into your development workflows.

Stay tuned for the next post, where we will delve into transforming the demo repository into a fully configured Nix Flake using
[Snowfall Lib](https://snowfall.org/guides/lib/quickstart/). In the meantime, I encourage you to explore my other post on
enhancing your Nix skills, [LevelUp Your Nix](https://blog.aiexcalibur.com/p/level-up-your-nix/). For a deeper understanding,
you might also find it insightful to read the [PhD thesis by Eelco Dolstra](https://edolstra.github.io/pubs/phd-thesis.pdf),
the creator of Nix, which lays the foundational concepts that have shaped this tool. Don't forget to subscribe or follow the
blog for updates, and dive into the demo repository to begin your hands-on journey with Nix. I welcome your thoughts and
feedback in the comments below.

Thank you for joining me on this exploration of Nix in the wild. Together, we can simplify and enhance our development
environments, ensuring consistency and reliability across all projects.
