Welcome to The excalibur Blog!

I'm Matt, a senior data scientist and developer with a passion for technology and open source software. This blog is a space where I share my thoughts, insights, and experiences on various tech topics.

## About Me

I am an enthusiast of open source software and take pleasure in working with my ThinkPad. With a well-equipped homelab, I enjoy exploring and experimenting with new technological innovations. My journey in technology has led me from Arch Linux to NixOS, driven by a quest for a more deterministic and reliable system. Despite the inevitable challenges, my passion for problem-solving and understanding complex systems remains unwavering.

## About The Blog

The excalibur Blog is a personal blog where I share the tech topics I find interesting, with a particular focus on my journey to do more and more with Nix. This space is not only a repository for my personal readmes but also a way to give back to the internet community that has been instrumental in my self-learning journey.

You'll find a variety of content here, ranging from deep dives into open source projects to explorations of data science techniques. While NixOS and its ecosystem will feature prominently, Iâ€™ll also cover other intriguing technologies and discoveries I stumble upon over time.

This blog reflects my personal interests and the tools and systems I work with regularly. My primary goal is to document my learnings and provide helpful resources for others navigating similar paths.

Thank you for visiting The excalibur Blog. I hope you find the content informative and engaging. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or comments.

Happy reading!

Matt Camp
