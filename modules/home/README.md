# User-Level Applications and Configurations

Welcome to the directory for user-specific configurations, designed exclusively for use with `home-manager`.

## Scope and Purpose

Unlike the configurations found in `../nixos`, this folder is dedicated solely to user-level applications and settings. It's important to note that no system-wide applications or services should be included here.

## How to Use

Place your user-specific configurations and applications in this directory, following the guidelines and structure provided in the main documentation. These configurations will be managed by `home-manager`, ensuring a seamless user experience without affecting system-wide settings.

For more detailed instructions and examples, please refer to the main project README or the corresponding documentation.
