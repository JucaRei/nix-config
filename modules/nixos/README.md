# System-Level Applications and Configurations

Welcome to the directory for system-wide configurations, designed to manage applications and services that affect the entire system.

## Scope and Purpose

Unlike the user-specific configurations found in the `../home` directory, this folder is dedicated to system-wide applications and services. Here, you can define configurations that apply to the entire system, affecting all users and core functionalities.

## How to Use

Place your system-level configurations and applications in this directory, following the guidelines and structure provided in the main documentation. These configurations will be managed at the system level, ensuring a consistent and controlled environment across the entire platform.

For more detailed instructions and examples, please refer to the main project README or the corresponding documentation.
